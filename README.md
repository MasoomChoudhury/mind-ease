# MindEase

A compassionate AI-powered mental wellness companion that provides accessible support and evidence-based techniques for anyone navigating life's challenges.

## Why I Built This

Mental health support shouldn't be a luxury. After seeing friends and family struggle with stress, anxiety, and finding the right resources, I wanted to create something that could offer immediate, judgment-free support anytime, anywhere.

MindEase combines the accessibility of technology with proven therapeutic techniques to help people develop healthy coping mechanisms and find moments of peace in their daily lives.

## What It Does

MindEase offers guided support through five evidence-based wellness techniques:

- **Mindfulness Meditation** - Anchoring yourself in the present moment
- **Gratitude Journaling** - Shifting focus toward life's positive aspects  
- **Cognitive Reframing** - Challenging and changing negative thought patterns
- **5-4-3-2-1 Grounding** - Quick anxiety relief through sensory awareness
- **Progressive Muscle Relaxation** - Releasing physical tension and stress

The AI guide provides step-by-step instructions, adapts to your needs, and maintains a gentle, non-judgmental tone throughout your wellness journey.

## Built With

- **React** - For a responsive, interactive user experience

## A Note on Mental Health

While MindEase provides valuable support and coping techniques, it's not a replacement for professional mental health care. If you're experiencing a mental health crisis, please reach out to a qualified professional or contact a crisis helpline immediately.
